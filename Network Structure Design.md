# Network Structure Design for Stock Index Price Prediction

Based on the comprehensive research conducted, I'll design a network structure for predicting stock index prices (such as S&P 500) using LSTM as the primary architecture, which has demonstrated high accuracy (93%) in recent studies.

## Overall Architecture

The proposed model will be a hybrid deep learning architecture with the following components:

1. **Input Layer**: Processes time-series data with technical indicators
2. **LSTM Layers**: Multiple stacked LSTM layers for sequence learning
3. **Dense Layers**: For final prediction output
4. **Optional Attention Mechanism**: To improve focus on relevant time periods

## Detailed Network Structure

```
Input Layer (sequence of historical prices and technical indicators)
    ↓
Normalization Layer (Min-Max scaling or Z-score normalization)
    ↓
LSTM Layer 1 (128 units, return sequences=True)
    ↓
Dropout Layer (20% dropout rate to prevent overfitting)
    ↓
LSTM Layer 2 (64 units, return sequences=False)
    ↓
Dropout Layer (20% dropout rate)
    ↓
Dense Layer 1 (32 units, activation='relu')
    ↓
Dense Layer 2 (1 unit, activation='linear') → Output (predicted price)
```

## Input Features

The input to the network will be a sequence of data points, where each data point includes:

1. **Historical price data**:
   - Closing prices (primary target)
   - Opening prices
   - High prices
   - Low prices
   - Volume

2. **Technical indicators**:
   - Simple Moving Average (SMA) with different window sizes (5, 10, 20 days)
   - Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
   - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
   - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
   - Bollinger Bands

## Hyperparameters

- **Sequence Length**: 50 days (lookback window)
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Learning Rate**: 0.001 with Adam optimizer
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- **Early Stopping**: Monitor validation loss with patience=10
- **Training/Validation/Test Split**: 70%/10%/20%

## Model Variants

For comparison and potential ensemble methods, we'll also consider:

1. **Bidirectional LSTM**: To capture information from both past and future states
   ```
   Input → Normalization → Bidirectional LSTM → Dropout → Dense → Output
   ```

2. **CNN-LSTM Hybrid**: Using CNN for feature extraction before sequence modeling
   ```
   Input → Normalization → 1D CNN → MaxPooling → LSTM → Dropout → Dense → Output
   ```

3. **Attention-based LSTM**: Adding attention mechanism to focus on relevant time steps
   ```
   Input → Normalization → LSTM → Attention Layer → Dense → Output
   ```

## Implementation Framework

The model will be implemented using:
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the deep learning models
- **Scikit-learn**: For data preprocessing and evaluation metrics
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations

This architecture balances complexity and performance, incorporating the most successful elements from the research while maintaining computational efficiency.
