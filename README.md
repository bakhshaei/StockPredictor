## Introduction

Stock market prediction has been a significant area of research in machine learning and finance. Predicting stock index prices, such as the S&P 500, is particularly challenging due to the market's inherent volatility, complexity, and sensitivity to numerous factors including economic conditions, company performance, global events, and investor sentiment.

This document presents a comprehensive approach to designing a machine learning application for stock index price prediction. It covers the entire pipeline from research and network architecture design to data preparation, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The focus is on leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which have demonstrated superior performance in capturing temporal dependencies in time-series data.

## Research Summary

### 4. Data Transformation

#### Normalization/Standardization
- **Min-Max Scaling**: Scale features to [0,1] range
  ```python
  from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
  scaler = MinMaxScaler()
  scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)
  ```
  
- **Z-score Standardization**: Transform to mean=0, std=1
  ```python
  from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
  scaler = StandardScaler()
  standardized_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)
  ```

#### Stationarity Transformation

- Log transformation for variance stabilization
- Seasonal decomposition if seasonal patterns exist

### 5. Sequence Creation

#### Time Series to Supervised Learning
- Create sliding windows of data (lookback periods)
- For each window, target is the next day's closing price
- Example with 50-day lookback:
  ```python
  def create_sequences(data, seq_length):
      X, y = [], []
      for i in range(len(data) - seq_length):
          X.append(data[i:i + seq_length])
          y.append(data[i + seq_length, 0])  # Assuming close price is at index 0
      return np.array(X), np.array(y)
      
  X, y = create_sequences(scaled_data, seq_length=50)
  ```

### 6. Data Splitting

#### Chronological Splitting
- **Training set**: Oldest 70% of data
- **Validation set**: Next 10% of data
- **Test set**: Most recent 20% of data
- Maintain chronological order (no random splitting)
- Example:
  ```python
  train_size = int(0.7 * len(X))
  val_size = int(0.1 * len(X))
  
  X_train, y_train = X[:train_size], y[:train_size]
  X_val, y_val = X[train_size:train_size+val_size], y[train_size:train_size+val_size]
  X_test, y_test = X[train_size+val_size:], y[train_size+val_size:]
  ```

      signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
      signals['signal'] = 0.0
      
      # Create short and long moving averages
      signals['short_ma'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=short_window).mean()
      signals['long_ma'] = data['Close'].rolling(window=long_window).mean()
      
      # Create signals
      signals['signal'][short_window:] = np.where(
          signals['short_ma'][short_window:] > signals['long_ma'][short_window:], 1.0, 0.0)
